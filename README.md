# Statistical-Arbitrage-Model
For a family of stocks, generally belonging to the same sector or industry, there exists a correlation between prices of each of the stocks. There, though, exist anomalous times when for a small period of time, the correlation is broken. But the market self corrects in some time and the correlation is re-established. During this small window of time when correlation is anomalous, there exists a money-making opportunity for quantitative traders. Problem Statement: Develop Machine Learning Algorithm to predict statistical arbitrage opportunities in NSE based on the 2016 data. Test this algorithm on 2017 data.
